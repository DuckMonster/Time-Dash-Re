Time Dash is a game currently being developed by [us], which focuses on delivering a fast-paced reaction-based competitive experience.

In Time Dash, your character has the power to dash back one second in time, obliterating everything on the way. This mechanic will emphasis players to master the acrobatic tools we're providing, such as double-jump, wall-jump and a quick dodge ability, to outmaneuver their opponents, placing them in the deadly line of the past.

We here at [company] are very passionate about our game and are placing our hearts into the project, and want our game to be as good as possible before the release. That's why we value community feedback, and would like it if you would share your mind (good or bad) on our game! Our dream is to form this subreddit as a forum for discussion and involvement in the development process.
